# Laravel Scribe
Spend less time worrying about maintaining docs and more time writing great code.

## Getting Started
Install the package as a dev dependency to your project.

```
composer require --dev omarrida/laravel-scribe
```

Run  the `scribe:generate` command to generate API docs. You should see a `scribe.md` file appear in your project's root directory.

```
php artisan scribe:generate
```
